    <h3>Cinque Terre ,Italy</h3>
    <div>
        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\cinque-terre.jpg"/>
        <p>
            The Cinque Terre  consists of five small villages (“cinque terre” means “five lands” in Italian)
            which cling to the Ligurian cliffs along Italy’s western coast.The tiny towns are incredibly popular with
             backpackers/budget travelers.The number one thing people who visit the Cinque Terre are there to do is hike –
             there are fantastic hiking trails that connect all five towns, mostly right along the cliffs.Cinque terre is
             famous for a deliciously sweet dessert wine called Sciacchetrà (pronounced shah|keh|TRAH; try it with biscotti),
              a few nice sunbathing beaches, and excellent seafood.

    <h3> Black Forest, Germany</h3>
    <div>
        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\final-castle.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Home of the cuckoo clock and Black forest gateau, the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) gets its name from its dark, slightly sinister canopy of evergreens:
            this is where Hansel and Gretel encountered the wicked witch. The vast expanse of hills, valleys, rivers and forests stretch
            from the swish spa town of Baden-Baden to the Swiss border, and from the Rhine almost to Lake Constance.
            Twenty minutes walk - or a five-minute bike ride - from populated spots will almost always put you out in nature,
            in the middle of quiet countryside dotted with traditional farmhouses and amiable dairy cows and thick forests.

    <h3>Salzburg, Austria</h3>
    <div>
        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\salzburg.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Salzburg, the storybook Old Town burrowed below steep hills looks much as it did when Mozart lived here 250 years ago.
            Standing beside the fast-flowing Salzach River, your gaze is raised inch by inch to graceful domes and spires, the formidable
            clifftop fortress and the mountains beyond. Beyond Salzburg’s two biggest money-spinners – Mozart and The Sound of Music –
             hides a city with a burgeoning arts scene, wonderful food, manicured parks, quiet side streets where classical music wafts
             from open windows, and concert halls that uphold musical tradition 365 days a year.

    <h3>Petra, Jordan</h3>

        <p>
            Petra , originally known to the Nabataeans as Raqmu, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. The city is famous
             for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Another name for Petra is the Rose City due to the color of the stone out
             of which it is carved.Established possibly as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Arab Nabataeans, it is Jordan's most-visited
             tourist attraction.Entrance to the city is through the Siq, a narrow gorge, over 1km in length, which is flanked on either side by
             soaring, 80m high cliffs. Just walking through the Siq is an experience in itself.

    <h3>  Machu Picchu ,Peru</h3>
    <div>
        <img src = "C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\maccu.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th
            century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar,
            intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.
            For many visitors to Peru and even South America, a visit to the Inca city of Machu Picchu is the long-anticipated highpoint of
            their trip. In a spectacular location, it’s the best-known archaeological site on the continent. This awe-inspiring ancient city
            was never revealed to the conquering Spaniards and was virtually forgotten until the early part of the 20th century.
            Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

    <h3>  Venice ,Italy </h3>

        <p>
            Venice, the capital of northern Italy’s Veneto region, is built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea.
            It has no roads, just canals – including the Grand Canal thoroughfare – lined with Renaissance and Gothic palaces.
            The central square, Piazza San Marco, contains St. Mark’s Basilica, which is tiled with Byzantine mosaics, and the Campanile bell
            tower offering views of the city’s red roofs.Few cities can claim such a priceless art and history heritage as Venice. This unique city with its magical, spectacular scenery
            is not just beautiful; it is a real miracle of creative genius: a city built on mud, sand and the slime of a difficult,
            inhospitable landscape.
