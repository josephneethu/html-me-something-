        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\northern-lights.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Landmannalaugar is a place in the Fjallabak Nature Reserve in the Highlands of Iceland.Its a popular spot to see northern lights
            also famous for mind-blowing multicoloured mountains, soothing hot springs, rambling lava flows and clear blue lakes .The area is
            the official starting point for the famous Laugavegurinn hike.
        </p>
    <h3>Cinque Terre ,Italy</h3>
        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\cinque-terre.jpg"/>
        <p>
            The Cinque Terre  consists of five small villages (“cinque terre” means “five lands” in Italian)
            which cling to the Ligurian cliffs along Italy’s western coast.The tiny towns are incredibly popular with
             backpackers/budget travelers.The number one thing people who visit the Cinque Terre are there to do is hike –
             there are fantastic hiking trails that connect all five towns, mostly right along the cliffs.Cinque terre is
             famous for a deliciously sweet dessert wine called Sciacchetrà (pronounced shah|keh|TRAH; try it with biscotti),
              a few nice sunbathing beaches, and excellent seafood.
        </p>
    <h3> Black Forest, Germany</h3>
        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\final-castle.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Home of the cuckoo clock, the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) gets its name from its dark, slightly sinister canopy of evergreens:
            this is where Hansel and Gretel encountered the wicked witch. The vast expanse of hills, valleys, rivers and forests stretch
            from the swish spa town of Baden-Baden to the Swiss border, and from the Rhine almost to Lake Constance.
            Twenty minutes walk - or a five-minute bike ride - from populated spots will almost always put you out in nature,
            in the middle of quiet countryside dotted with traditional farmhouses and amiable dairy cows and thick forests.
        </p>

    <h3>Salzburg, Austria</h3>
        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\salzburg.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Salzburg, the storybook Old Town burrowed below steep hills looks much as it did when Mozart lived here 250 years ago.
            Standing beside the fast-flowing Salzach River, your gaze is raised inch by inch to graceful domes and spires, the formidable
            clifftop fortress and the mountains beyond. Beyond Salzburg’s two biggest money-spinners – Mozart and The Sound of Music –
             hides a city with a burgeoning arts scene, wonderful food, manicured parks, quiet side streets where classical music wafts
             from open windows, and concert halls that uphold musical tradition 365 days a year.

        </p>
    <h3>Petra, Jordan</h3>
        <img src ="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\petra.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Petra , originally known to the Nabataeans as Raqmu, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. The city is famous
             for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Another name for Petra is the Rose City due to the color of the stone out
             of which it is carved.Established possibly as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Arab Nabataeans, it is Jordan's most-visited
             tourist attraction.Entrance to the city is through the Siq, a narrow gorge, over 1km in length, which is flanked on either side by
             soaring, 80m high cliffs. Just walking through the Siq is an experience in itself.
        </p>
    <h3>  Machu Picchu ,Peru</h3>
        <img src = "C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\maccu.jpg"/>
        <p>
            For many visitors to Peru and even South America, a visit to the Inca city of Machu Picchu is the long-anticipated highpoint of
            their trip. In a spectacular location, it’s the best-known archaeological site on the continent. This awe-inspiring ancient city
            was never revealed to the conquering Spaniards and was virtually forgotten until the early part of the 20th century.
            Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
        </p>
    <h3>  Venice ,Italy </h3>
        <img src="C:\Users\neethu joseph\code\html-me-something\images\venice.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Few cities can claim such a priceless art and history heritage as Venice. This unique city with its magical, spectacular scenery
            is not just beautiful; it is a real miracle of creative genius: a city built on mud, sand and the slime of a difficult,
            inhospitable landscape.
