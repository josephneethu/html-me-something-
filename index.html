            The Cinque Terre  consists of five small villages (“cinque terre” means “five lands” in Italian) which cling to the Ligurian
            cliffs along Italy’s western coast.The tiny towns are incredibly popular with travelers.The number one thing people who visit
            the Cinque Terre are there to do is hike –there are fantastic hiking trails that connect all five towns, mostly right along the
            cliffs.Cinque terre is famous for a deliciously sweet dessert wine called Sciacchetrà ,a few nice prestine beaches, and excellent
            seafood.

            Home of the cuckoo clock and Black forest gateau, the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) gets its name from its dark, slightly sinister
            canopy of evergreens:this is where Hansel and Gretel encountered the wicked witch. The vast expanse of hills, valleys, rivers and
            forests stretch from the swish spa town of Baden-Baden to the Swiss border, and from the Rhine almost to Lake Constance.Twenty
            minutes walk - or a five-minute bike ride - from populated spots will almost always put you out in nature,in the middle of quiet
            countryside dotted with traditional farmhouses and amiable dairy cows and thick forests.

            Salzburg, the storybook Old Town burrowed below steep hills looks much as it did when Mozart lived here 250 years ago.Standing
            beside the fast-flowing Salzach River, your gaze is raised inch by inch to graceful domes and spires, the formidable
            clifftop fortress and the mountains beyond. Beyond Salzburg’s two biggest money-spinners – Mozart and The Sound of Music –
            hides a city with a burgeoning arts scene, wonderful food, manicured parks, quiet side streets where classical music wafts
            from open windows, and concert halls that uphold musical tradition 365 days a year.

            Petra , originally known to the Nabataeans as Raqmu, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. The city is famous
            for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Another name for Petra is the Rose City due to the color of the stone out
            of which it is carved.Established possibly as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Arab Nabataeans, it is Jordan's most-visited
            tourist attraction.Entrance to the city is through the Siq, a narrow gorge, over 1km in length, which is flanked on either side by
            soaring, 80m high cliffs.

            Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th
            century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar,
            intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.
            For many visitors to Peru and even South America, a visit to the Inca city of Machu Picchu is the long-anticipated highpoint of
            their trip. In a spectacular location, it’s the best-known archaeological site on the continent. This awe-inspiring ancient city
            was never revealed to the conquering Spaniards and was virtually forgotten until the early part of the 20th century.
            Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

            Venice, the capital of northern Italy’s Veneto region, is built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea.
            It has no roads, just canals – including the Grand Canal thoroughfare – lined with Renaissance and Gothic palaces.The central
            square, Piazza San Marco, contains St. Mark’s Basilica, which is tiled with Byzantine mosaics, and the Campanile belltower offering
            views of the city’s red roofs.Few cities can claim such a priceless art and history heritage as Venice. This unique city with its
            magical, spectacular scenery is not just beautiful; it is a real miracle of creative genius.
